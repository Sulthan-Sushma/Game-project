HTML Structure: The HTML file includes a button to start the game and a hidden game area that appears once the game starts.
JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript code initializes the game, handles player choices, determines the computer's choice,
decides the winner, and displays the result. The determineWinner function has been corrected to include template literals for
proper string interpolation.
